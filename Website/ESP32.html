    <h2>Electronics Circuits and Components Overview</h2>
    <p>During this week‚Äôs session, we explored a broad introduction to various fundamental electronic components.The components discussed were as follows:</p>
    <p><em>-Resistors:-</em> Regulate voltage and current, crucial for setting logic levels in embedded circuits.</p>
    <p><em>-Capacitors:-</em>Stabilize power supply and filter noise in microcontroller systems.</p>
    <p><em>-Inductors:-</em>Support power regulation and signal filtering in embedded power supplies.</p>
    <p><em>-Diodes:-</em>Ensure unidirectional current flow, protecting embedded systems from reverse polarity.</p>
    <p><em>-Relays:-</em>Enable embedded systems to control high-power devices with low-power signals.</p>
    <p><em>-Transistors:-</em>Act as switches or amplifiers for controlling digital logic and interfacing peripherals.</p>
    <p><em>-Quartz Crystals:-</em>Provide precise timing for microcontroller clocks in embedded applications.</p>
    <p>Each of these components plays a key role in electronic circuits, and the overview served as a foundation for understanding their individual functions and applications.</p>
