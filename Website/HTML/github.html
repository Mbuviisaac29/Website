    <h2>Git & GitHub Overview</h2>
    <p> ~This week, I went over Git and GitHub again to deepen my understanding of version control and repository management. The session highlightedthe basics of Git, standard workflows on GitHub, and how these tools are applied in real-world project collaboration. Git serves as a distributed version control system that supports efficient teamwork among developers. I revisited several fundamental concepts during this review: </p>
    <p>- <em>Initializing a Repository:</em> Using git init to create a new local repository </p>
    <p>- <em>Cloning a Repository:</em>Using git clone <repository_url> to copy an existing repository.</p>
    <p>- <em>Committing Changes:</em> Using git add . and git commit -m "message" to track changes.</p>
    <p>- <em>Branching and Merging:</em> Managing branches using git branch and git merge.</p>
    <p>- <em>Pushing and Pulling:</em> Syncing changes with a remote repository using git push and git pull.</p>
    <p>~GitHub provides cloud-based hosting for Git repositories, enabling collaboration and version control.</p>
    <p>~Key areas reviewed include:</p>
    <h3>1.Created GitHub Account</h3>
    <p>I set up my GitHub account in 2020 to organize my projects and participate in open-source contributions.</p>
    <p>You can find my profile below</p>
    <a href="https://github.com/Mbuviisaac29/Website" target="_blank">GitHub</a>
    <h3>2.Repository Creation</h3>
    <p>Following the account setup, I proceeded to explore the process of repository creation on GitHub. A repository (or "repo") serves as a centralized space where project files, including code, documentation, and other resources, are stored and managed. I practiced creating both public and private repositories, initializing them with README files, and configuring .gitignore to exclude unnecessary files. Additionally, I learned how to clone repositories to a local machine, make changes using Git commands, and push updates back to the remote repository. This hands-on experience reinforced my understanding of how repositories serve as the foundation for version control, collaboration, and project tracking in a development environment.</p>
    <h3>3.Created HTML & CSS Documents</h3>
    <p>With Visual Studio Code, I developed an index.html file that included my profile details and hyperlinks to different modules. To support the first module, I created a module1.html file for documentation purposes and styled the content using a documentation.css file to improve its visual presentation.</p>
    <p>I also used Markdown files to provide concise summaries of the module content. All changes were tracked using Git, and once finalized, the updates were pushed to GitHub for version control and remote access.</p>
    <h4>3.1Markdown</h4>
    <p>This markup language allows users to format plain text documents in a simple and efficient way.</p>
    <p>Markdown provides the following key features and advantages:</p>
    <p>- <em>Simplicity and Readability</em></p>
    <p>-<em>Platform Independence</em></p>
    <p>-<em>Customization and Extensions</em></p>
    <p>-<em>Version Control Friendly</em></p>
    <p>-<em>Lightweight Syntax</em></p>
    <p>Markdown comes in handy in:</p>
    <p>-<em>Content Management Systems (CMS)</em></p>
    <p>-<em>Collaborative Writing</em></p>
    <p>-<em>Issue Tracking and Project Management</em></p>
    <p>-<em>Technical Documentation</em></p>
    <p>-<em>Learning Management Systems (LMS)</em></p>
    <p>-<em>Configuration and Metadata Files</em></p>
    <p>-<em>Automation and DevOps Documentation</em></p>
    <p>-<em>Software Testing Reports</em></p>
    <p>Markup is a broad term for languages used to structure and format documents, often using tags. Examples include HTML, XML, and LaTeX.</p>
    <p>Markdown is a lightweight markup language designed for easy readibility and conversion to HTML that commonly uses plain text symbols.Examples include README files and documentation</p>
    <p>Markdownâ€™s main advantage is its clear, readable syntax combined with the ability to be transformed into HTML through various tools.</p>
