   <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
   <p>This report documents a comprehensive field excursion undertaken on 20th June 2025 in Kiambiu Slum, Nairobi County, Kenya, under the joint academic program between the University of Nairobi and the Technical University of Denmark (DTU). The visit aimed to assess the water, sanitation, and waste management conditions under the WASH framework and identify potential solutions adaptable to the socioeconomic and environmental realities of low-income urban settlements. Findings indicate severe inadequacies in water availability and safety, unstructured and hazardous wastewater disposal, and inefficient solid waste collection and disposal mechanisms. Community feedback revealed openness to change and innovation provided solutions are cost-effective, locally manageable, and accessible. The report concludes with tailored engineering and environmental recommendations, which will be used as a foundation for a proposed innovation and business model.</p>
   <h2 id="section-introduction">Introduction</h2>
   <p>Kiambiu is a densely populated informal settlement situated in Nairobi, characterized by inadequate access to basic services such as water, sanitation, and waste management. Rapid urbanization without matching infrastructure development has led to heightened environmental and public health risks. This site visit was conducted to better understand localized challenges under the WASH framework and explore viable, scalable interventions based on community input, field evidence, and sustainable engineering design principles whereas the report serves as a precursor to an innovation and business planning framework, emphasizing locally adaptable technologies and community engagement for implementation.</p>
