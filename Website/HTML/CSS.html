    <h3>Created HTML & CSS Documents</h3>
    <p>With Visual Studio Code, I developed an index.html file that included my profile details and hyperlinks to different modules. To support the first module, I created a module1.html file for documentation purposes and styled the content using a documentation.css file to improve its visual presentation.</p>
    <p>I also used Markdown files to provide concise summaries of the module content. All changes were tracked using Git, and once finalized, the updates were pushed to GitHub for version control and remote access.</p>
