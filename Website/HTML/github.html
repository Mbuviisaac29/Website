    <h2>Git & GitHub Overview</h2>
    <p> ~This week, I went over Git and GitHub again to deepen my understanding of version control and repository management. The session highlightedthe basics of Git, standard workflows on GitHub, and how these tools are applied in real-world project collaboration. Git serves as a distributed version control system that supports efficient teamwork among developers. I revisited several fundamental concepts during this review: </p>
    <p>- <em>Initializing a Repository:</em> Using git init to create a new local repository </p>
    <p>- <em>Cloning a Repository:</em>Using git clone <repository_url> to copy an existing repository.</p>
    <p>- <em>Committing Changes:</em> Using git add . and git commit -m "message" to track changes.</p>
    <p>- <em>Branching and Merging:</em> Managing branches using git branch and git merge.</p>
    <p>- <em>Pushing and Pulling:</em> Syncing changes with a remote repository using git push and git pull.</p>
    <p>~GitHub provides cloud-based hosting for Git repositories, enabling collaboration and version control.</p>
    <p>~Key areas reviewed include:</p>
    <h3>1.Created GitHub Account</h3>
    <p>I set up my GitHub account in 2020 to organize my projects and participate in open-source contributions.</p>
    <p>You can find my profile below</p>

    <h3>2.Repository Creation</h3>
    <p>Following the account setup, I proceeded to explore the process of repository creation on GitHub. A repository (or "repo") serves as a centralized space where project files, including code, documentation, and other resources, are stored and managed. I practiced creating both public and private repositories, initializing them with README files, and configuring .gitignore to exclude unnecessary files. Additionally, I learned how to clone repositories to a local machine, make changes using Git commands, and push updates back to the remote repository. This hands-on experience reinforced my understanding of how repositories serve as the foundation for version control, collaboration, and project tracking in a development environment.</p>
